    <h4>Flask Web Application with Linux, Apache, PostgreSQL back-end</h4>
</center>

<br>

<p>This is my second full stack web application utilizing Python. I took time to understand more advanced Flask concepts and read 
from <a href="https://github.com/miguelgrinberg">Miguel Grinberg's</a> <i>"Flask Web Development"</i> in order to improve as a back-end developer.<p>

<h6>Concepts Learned From Project</h6>
<ul>
    <li>SSHSF - I'm confident in handling VM environments locally now.</li>
    <li>Flask - I learned how to properly organize Flask applications based upon their size. This is a small-scale product, so I went
    with a <a href="http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/organizing.html#single-module">single module organization</a>.</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL - Postgres was mandated for the project, but after 
    <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems">reading about the differences 
    between MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL</a>... concurrent read/writes reveals Postgres to be the right choice.</li>
    <li>psycopg2 - As opposed to SQLAlchemy for RDBMS's</li>
    <li>Jinja2 - Templating has saved my life <3</li>
</ul>
